# PowershellScripts
This is a respository of a lot of Scripts I use on a regular basis.

They include scripts focused primarily on: Exchange Online, Outlook.com Cloud Cache, SharePoint, Office 365 and Azure Scripts.

Please note that newer scripts will have a better effort of trying to make them more generic.  With variables and settings up near the top and all parameters clearly defined.  Hopefully this will make them a bit easier to use in your setup.  

Some of these Powershell scripts have been written by me, while other portions may have been shared by others.  If they have been given by someone else I will declare the script author in the top of the ps1 file.
